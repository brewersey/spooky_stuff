These notebooks were used to analyze the Kaggle spooky author data set (https://www.kaggle.com/spooky-author-identification/data).  I discovered this dataset late so the prediction have not been scored by Kaggle.

The spooky_stuff.ipynb file containts some basic data exploration.  The sentiment analysis was conducted using Varder (http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf)

Different models were used to make the predictions:
spooky_stuff_3_logic – use linear and probabilistic models
spooky_stuff_4_nn – uses a neural network model
spooky_stuff_5_bayes – uses a naive Bayes model
